# Website maintenance / 网站维护

Production: https://create.gosim.org/factory26/
Source: https://github.com/gosimfoundation/factory26

This repository owns this event. Make future changes and pull requests here.
The former `gosimfoundation/hackathon` event directory is retired.

## Development

Use Node.js 22. Run `npm ci` and
`npm run dev`.

## Publishing

Merge into `main`. **Publish event site** builds and validates the website, then
publishes a versioned GitHub Release containing `site.tar.gz` and its SHA-256.
A failed build does not replace the previous successful release.

The shared publisher at https://github.com/gosimfoundation/hackathon polls for
successful releases on its existing five-minute schedule. GitHub may delay
scheduled runs. For an immediate refresh, run **Deploy hackathon sites to GitHub
Pages** manually in that repository after this repository's release succeeds.
No cross-repository personal access token is required.

The URL and Supabase authentication callbacks stay unchanged. Only PUBLIC
`VITE_SUPABASE_URL` and `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` client configuration goes into
repository Actions variables. Never put a service-role/admin key there.

To reproduce a release locally, set those public variables (not needed for
Agent App), install dependencies, and run `node scripts/release-site.mjs`.
For Survey, also run `npm ci --prefix legacy-event` first.

To roll back, set this event's `release` in the shared publisher's
`config/event-sites.json` to a known-good `site-...` release tag and redeploy.
Set it back to `latest` to resume automatic updates.
